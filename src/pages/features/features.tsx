          <p>
            Scissor allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the
            Scissor platform, and a shorter URL is automatically generated. The
            shortened URL is designed to be as fast as possible, making sharing
            on social media or other channels easy

          <p>
            Scissor also allows users to generate QR codes for the shortened
            URLs. Users can download and use the QR code image in their
            promotional materials or/or on their website. This feature will be
            implemented using a third-party QR code generator API, which can be
            integrated into the Scissor platform.

          <h3>DATA ANALYTICS</h3>
          <p>
            Scissor provides basic analytics that allows users to track the
            performance of their shortened URLs. Users can see how many clicks
            their shortened URL has received and where the clicks are coming
            from. This feature will be implemented using Firebaseâ€™s built-in
            analytics feature.
